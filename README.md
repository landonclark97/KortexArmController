# KortexArmController

## Description
This package exposes some elementary features of the ROS Kortex package - these include position control, velocity control, and gripper commands. An additional goal is to extrapolate on the aforementioned low level functions to provide inverse kinematics (at the position and possibly the velocity levels) functionality.

## Installation
* `git clone https://github.com/landonclark97/KortexArmController.git`
* `cd KortexArmController/`
* `pip install .`

## Usage
* `import KortexArm from kortex_arm_controller.kortex_arm
arm = KortexArm()`
* We can add more here as time goes on
